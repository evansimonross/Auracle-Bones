# Auracle-Bones
A simple puzzle RPG game.

## How to Play


## Project History
This project was a homework assignment for the Columbia Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp, testing our preliminary ability to use JQuery. The project had two possible prompts we could choose from. One was a number guessing game in which the player had to figure out the values associated with images on a screen and add them up to an arbitrary goal. The other was a simple turn-based RPG game with hit-points and character images. After a conversation with a classmate on the subway home, I realized I wanted to somehow combine both prompts. Much brainstorming later, and I came up with the concept for Auracle Bones.

I had a big vision for this project, and I am very pleased with the way it turned out. It was challenging getting the complex behavior that I wanted out of the game, but with some patience and working step-by-step, I was able to accomplish what I had set out to do: to employ the number guessing game seemlessly as a battle mechanic for an RPG. I also believe that the concept could work for a more fleshed-out story-driven RPG sometime in the future. If any artists would be interested in a collaboration of sorts, please let me know!

If you found your way here, I hope you have fun playing around with this little game! If you have any ideas for improvement, don't be shy about letting me know or forking the project for yourself to play around with.
